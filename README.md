# 👋 Hi, I'm Kokob

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Application Development and learning full stack web development through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). I’m still early in my journey, but I’m focused on building real projects, learning by doing, and improving with every line of code.

## 📌 A Bit About Me

- I enjoy learning through hands-on coding
- I take time to understand core concepts, not just copy code
- Currently working with: **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **React**, **Node.js**, **Git**, and **GitHub**

## 💻 What I'm Doing Now

- Building small projects to reinforce my learning
- Using Git and GitHub to stay organized and track progress
- Exploring tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to support my growth

## 🧰 Tools I Use

- **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Frontend:** React (beginner), responsive design basics

### 🙌 Shoutout & Reflection

Big thanks to [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) the game-changer in my web dev journey. Unlike other tutorials, this one actually stuck.

What I learned:
- GitHub code hosting
- Terminal navigation
- Building real projects
- Reading documentation (crucial skill!)

Yes, I made mistakes, but that’s how real learning works. Each project challenged me and taught me something new.

The Odin Project’s hands-on, project-based approach made all the difference. Tutorials are useful, but nothing beats actually building and applying what you learn.

Thanks for checking out my work — I’m here to learn and grow every day.  
Feel free to follow along!
