# 👋 Hi, I'm Kokob

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Application Development and learning full stack web development through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). I’m early in my journey, but I’m focused on building real projects, learning by doing, and improving every day.

## 💻 What I'm Doing Now

- Building small projects to practice and grow
