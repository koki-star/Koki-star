I’m pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Application Development, focused on building full-stack web applications across both frontend and backend. I use GitHub to apply what I learn through hands-on projects and to document my progress as I build real applications.

I’m interested in building complete web applications, working on both user-facing interfaces and backend logic, and learning how different parts of an application work together.

## 🔧 What I’m Working On

I’m building full-stack projects that combine frontend development with backend functionality. My current focus is on strengthening my understanding of Django, relational databases, and SQL, while continuing to improve my frontend skills with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I also spend time improving code readability, debugging skills, and using Git and GitHub consistently as part of my workflow.

## 📌 What You’ll Find Here

Frontend and full-stack web projects.  
Python and Django practice repositories.  
Projects that show steady improvement and practical learning.

I’m early in my journey, but I’m consistent, curious, and focused on learning by building complete applications.

Thanks for stopping by.
